    "# Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the predictors in your dataset as dimensions in what we can usefully call \"feature space\". If we're predicting house prices, then we might have a 'square feet' dimension or a 'number of bathrooms' dimension, etc. Then each record (of a house or a house sale, say) would be represented as a point (or vector) in this feature space. Some would score higher on the 'latitude' dimension or lower on the 'number of bedrooms' dimension, or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difficulty is that, despite our working nomenclature, these things aren't really *dimensions* in the truest sense, since they're not independent of each other. When we talk about the x-, y-, and z-dimensions of Euclidean 3-space, for example, one important feature is that values of x have no bearing (per se) on values of y or of z. I can move three units along the x-dimension without changing my y- or z-position.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the analogous thing is generally not true for datasets. When I increase my position along the 'number of bedrooms' dimension (or, better, *direction*), I also tend to increase my position along, say, the 'square feet' direction as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is problematic for a couple reasons: One is that my model could be in effect \"double-counting\" certain features of my signal, which can lead to overfit models. And if my goal is inference or explanation, then I'm going to have a very hard time distinguishing between the idea that the number of bedrooms is what's *really* predictive of housing prices and the idea that the number of square feet is what's really so predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is to transform our dataset into something more useful for building models. What we want to do is to build new dimensions (predictors) out of the dimensions we are given in such a way that:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) each dimension we draw captures as much of the remaining variance among our predictors as possible; and <br/>\n",
    "(2) each dimension we draw is orthogonal to the ones we've already drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to multiple linear regression for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea is that I can get a better prediction for my dependent variable by considering a *linear combination of my predictors* than I can get by considering any one predictor by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ **PCA insight**: If the combinations of predictors work better than the predictors themselves, then let's just treat the combinations as our primary dimensions!\n",
    "\n",
    "But one problem with having lots of predictors is that it raises the chance that some will be nearly *collinear*.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ **PCA insight**: Since we're reconstructing our dimensions anyway, let's make sure that the dimensions we construct are mutually orthogonal! <br/>\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ **PCA insight**: Moreover, since we'll be capturing much of the variance among our predictors in the first few dimensions we construct, we'll be able in effect to *reduce  the dimensionality* of our problem. Thus PCA is a fundamental tool in *dimensionality reduction*."

    "## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to diagonalize (i.e. find the eigendecomposition of) the covariance matrix. The decomposition will produce a set of orthogonal vectors that explain as much of the remaining variance as possible. These are our [principal components](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/23596/why-is-the-eigenvector-of-a-covariance-matrix-equal-to-a-principal-component).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a word about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It turns out that eigenvalues and -vectors have a dizzying number of applications. But the basic idea is that, if we can split a bunch of vectors (i.e. a matrix) into a set of mutually orthogonal vectors, then we can isolate the force of the bunch into discrete bits, each of which by itself acts like a simple linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why the definition of an eigenvector is as it is: $\\vec{x}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $A$ if $A\\vec{x} = \\lambda\\vec{x}$, for some scalar $\\lambda$. That is, the vector is oriented in just such a direction that multiplying the matrix by it serves only to lengthen or shorten it.\n",

    "Suppose we have the matrix\n",

    "Let's calculate the eigendecomposition of this matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we set $(A - \\lambda I)\\vec{x} = 0$. One trivial solution is $\\vec{x} = \\vec{0}$, but if there are more interesting solutions, then it must be that $|A - \\lambda I| = 0$, which is to say that some column vector in $A - \\lambda I$ must be expressible as a linear combination of the other columns. (Otherwise, there would be no way to \"undo\" the multiplicative effect of a column vector on $\\vec{x}$!) For more on this point, see [this page](http://www2.math.uconn.edu/~troby/math2210f16/LT/sec1_7.pdf).\n",
